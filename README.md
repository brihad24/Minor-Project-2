# Minor-Project-2

This repository was created for Minor Project 2 as a part of my Computer Science course at UPES. The project is a web-based Food Recognition software built using InceptionV3 and achieved an accuracy of 81%.

The system uses the Django framework for the website to function smoothly. 
This system employs a highly advanced InceptionV3 network, which has undergone fine-tuning with customized weights to ensure that it can meticulously analyze and accurately predict food images that are submitted to it. The convolutional neural network (CNN) model has undergone rigorous training on the Food-101 dataset, ensuring that it delivers the highest level of prediction accuracy possible.

Furthermore, the system also shows the users a nutritional value breakdown of the food item that the user has chosen with the help of the Nutrionix API.
